# Office2016forMacRemoval
Shell Script to fully Remove Office for Mac 2016, including licensing files

This script may remove support files for other Microsoft Applications, and is released as-is with no warranty

Based on the work from: https://gist.github.com/pirafrank/18d62c062e2806c1d183

Rebuilt because the licence file was remaining after the script was run, not allowing for activating office under another account
